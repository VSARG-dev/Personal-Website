Hi! I am V. S. Abhinav Rahul Gandrakota, a final year Electronics & Instrumentation undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. I am mainly interested in the field of data science, especially Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. \
\
I am currently working with [Prof Ankur Bhattacharjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bhattacharjee/Profile) on using AI & Deep Learning based algorithms for
development and optimization of an efficient battery thermal management system. \
\
I got my first opportunity to work in the Deep Learning domain as part of my summer internship at [North Eastern Space Application Centre](https://nesac.gov.in), which involved 3D Semantic Segmentation task performed on satellite generated images. After that, I knew that I wanted to pursue my professional career in this domain. \
\
I've worked on many assignments and projects as part of the courses done under the data science minor. Some of them include Sign Language Translation and Alzheimer Helper. \
\
I've also worked on Robotics projects in the past, first in 10th grade, and then in my first year of college. Although I don't enjoy the theoretical aspect of electronics, I have always found working with actual hardware a lot of fun. I hope to get the opportunity to incorporate my knowledge of AI/ML along with Robotics in the future.\
\
I have always loved the subject of Mathematics, particularly Probability & Statistics. That was what, despite being an Electronics major, initially pushed me to explore the field of data science. \
\
In my free time, I like to read books, play football and work out. I've also recently started learning how to play the guitar. I hope I can learn how to play my favourite songs very soon! \
\
Feel free to contact me if you’d like to know more about my work!

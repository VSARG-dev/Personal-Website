Hi! I am V. S. Abhinav Rahul Gandrakota, a final year Electronics & Instrumentation undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. I am mainly interested in the field of data science, especially Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. \
\
I have always loved the subject of Mathematics ever since I was a child. That was what, despite being an Electronics major, initially pushed me to explore the field of data science, especially considering that my favourite part of Mathematics was Probability & Statistics. \
\
I got my first opportunity to work in the ML/DL domain as part of my summer internship at North Eastern Space Application Centre. After that, I knew that I wanted to pursue my professional career in this domain. \
\
I've worked on many assignments and projects as part of the courses done under the data science minor. Some of them include Sign Language Translation and Alzheimer Helper among others. These only further solidified my interest in this field. \
\
I've also worked on Robotics projects in the past, first in 10th grade in school, and then also in my first year in college. Although I dont enjoy the theoretical aspect of electronics, I have always found working with actual hardware a lot of fun. I hope to get the opportunity to incorporate my knowledge of AI/ML along with Robotics in the future.\
\
I am currently working with [Prof Ankur Bhattacharjee](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Hyderabad/bhattacharjee/Profile) on using AI/ML based algorithms for
development and optimization of an efficient thermal management system for Vanadium Redox Flow Battery under different charge-discharge conditions for Electric Vehicle applications. I hope to get a publication out of it! \
\
In my free time, I like to read books, play football and work out. I've also recently started learning how to play the guitar. I hope I can learn how to play my favourite songs very soon! \
\
Feel free to contact me if you’d like to know more about my work!

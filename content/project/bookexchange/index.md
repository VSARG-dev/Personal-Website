As part of the Object Oriented Programming course offered by our college, we were given the task of implementing a Mutual Book Exchange Portal keeping the OOP principles in mind. The purpose of this portal was to enable the registered users to exchange the books that they have with them, free of cost, allowing for temporary use and return of books. \
